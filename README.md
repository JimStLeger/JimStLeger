- 👋 Hey there, I’m @JimStLeger. Thanks for stopping by and caring enough to ReadMe.
- 👀 I’m interested in open source software projects focused on networking (DPDK, FD.io, etc.), edge computing (LF Edge), cloud native, and diversity and inclusion (Inclusive Naming Initiative.)
- 🌱 I’m learning every day. Navigating GitHub and becoming comfortable and, dare I say it, minimally competent would be a great accomplishment for me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative efforts to enable fully accessible platforms for everyone. Think screen readers, keyboard navigation, etc.
- 📫 You can find me on Slack (LF Edge, CNCF, Inclusive Naming, more), Twitter, LinkedIn, and likely other places.
